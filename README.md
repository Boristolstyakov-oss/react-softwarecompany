* Project Description
   * The majority of designs I used to make were low contrast, and I wanted this one to be different. This software company website has popping imperial red accents, which makes this one of my favorite pieces of work. I built the website upon React.js for the most efficient workflow.

* Technologies Used
  * React.js
  * Express
  * Node.js
* Running the Code
  * Clone this GitHub repository into a directory of your choice.
  ```git clone https://github.com/avhaymart/Software-Company-Website.git```
  * At the root of the directory, run```npm install```.
  * Run ```npm start```.
